          <p>
            Climate change is the long-term shifts in weather and temperature in the            world. Over the past 100 to 200 years, humans have been the main                    contributor in the increase of climate change across the world.

              Global warming is the rise of temperature globally due to greenhouse                gases. However, climate change is the long-term changes in climate such temperatures and percipitation.
