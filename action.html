              Reducing Food/Water Waste

            <p>
              Reducing waste and recycling can reduce the greenhouse gases transmitted into the atmosphere. They help save energy consumption for industrial and consumer uses.

            <p>
              Pulling plugs that are not in use can help conserve energy. They can also help you save up to $200.

            <p>
              The longer life span of lightbulbs, the lower the carbon emissions. LED lights last much longer than regular lightbulbs.

            <p>
              Renewable energy minimizes carbon pollution in the atmosphere. Changing to renewable energy can allow the world to replace carbon-intensive energy sources and reduce global warming.

            <p>
              Burning fossil fuels contribute to air pollution and worldwide climate change. The elimination of fossil fuels being burned would lower the average temperature, reduce the amount of carbon dioxide to stop global warming, and preventing air-related health problems.
